# Yesql - Clojure SQL queries rethought.

Yesql is a Clojure library for /using/ SQL queries.

## Rationale

You're writing Clojure. You need to write some SQL.

We're generally all agreed that this is a problem:

``` clojure
(query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE country_code = ?" "GB")
```

Unless these query strings are short, they quickly get hard to read
and hard to rewrite.

But something like this is not the solution:

``` clojure
(select :*
        (from :users)
        (where (= :country_code "GB")))
```

Clojure is a great language for writing DSLs, but we don't need a new
one. SQL is already a mature DSL.  And S-expressions are great, but
here they're not adding anything. This is parens-for-parens sake.
(Don't agree? Wait until this extra syntax layer breaks down and you
start wrestling with a `(raw-sql)` function.)

So what's the solution? Keep the SQL in SQL. Have one file with your
query:

``` sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE country_code = ?
```

...and then pull it in and use it as a regular Clojure function:

``` clojure
(defquery users-by-country "myproject/db/users-by-country.sql")

(users-by-country db-spec "GB")
```

By keeping the SQL and Clojure separate you get:

- No syntactic surprises. Your database doesn't stick to the SQL
  standard (because none of them do); Yesql doesn't care. You will
  never spend time hunting for "the equivalent sexpr syntax". You will
  never need to fallback to a `(raw-sql "some('funky'::SYNTAX)")` function.
- Better editor support. Your editor probably already has great SQL
  support. By keeping SQL in SQL, you get to use it.
- Team interoperability. Your DBAs can read and write the queries you
  use in your Clojure project.
- Easier performance tuning. Need to `EXPLAIN` that query plan? It's
  much easier when your query is ordinary SQL.
- Query reuse. Drop the same SQL files into other projects, because
  they're just plain ol' SQL. Share them as a submodule.
